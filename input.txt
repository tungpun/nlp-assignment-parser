By default, output files are written to the current directory.
Once an attacker has credentials for one user, the next stage begins which is lateral traversal. Lateral traversal means movement across a network between systems as the same user identity. The movement is considered lateral, as the attacker has not gained any new, elevated privileges yet. However, the attacker can read the memory on any system which their stolen user identity has administrative privileges. Attackers will then harvest more credentials from these systems, and repeat the process until they gain higher privileges. Given time and persistence, an attacker can often move deeply into a network and gain highly-privileged accounts.
One possible solution to stopping this problem is to simply disable SSO. This solution is viewed as not feasible as users can still be tricked into authenticating, legacy protocols still have credential-equivalent artifacts, and itâ€™s a poor user experience.
