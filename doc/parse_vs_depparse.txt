-- parse
--------

- Provides full syntactic analysis, 

- using both the constituent and the dependency representations. 

    + The constituent-based output is saved in TreeAnnotation. 

    + We generate three dependency-based outputs, as follows: basic, uncollapsed dependencies, saved in BasicDependenciesAnnotation; collapsed dependencies saved in CollapsedDependenciesAnnotation; and collapsed dependencies with processed coordinations, in CollapsedCCProcessedDependenciesAnnotation. Most users of our parser will prefer the latter representation. For more details on the parser, please see this page. For more details about the dependencies, please refer to this page.

-- depparse
-----------

- Provides a fast syntactic dependency parser. 

- using just dependency representations. 

    + We generate three dependency-based outputs, as follows: basic, uncollapsed dependencies, saved in BasicDependenciesAnnotation; collapsed dependencies saved in CollapsedDependenciesAnnotation; and collapsed dependencies with processed coordinations, in CollapsedCCProcessedDependenciesAnnotation. Most users of our parser will prefer the latter representation. For details about the dependency software, see this page. For more details about dependency parsing in general, see this page.
